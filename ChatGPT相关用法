Abandon [遗弃，抛弃] was something that Samantha had never been able [有能力的，能够做某事的] to do. She had always struggled with letting go of people and things,
and it had caused her a great deal of pain over the years. But now, as she sat in her empty apartment, she knew that it was time to move on.
It wasn't about [关于，大约] anyone else - it was about her. She had to find the ability [能力，才能] to be alone and to be okay with it. 
It was a daunting prospect, but she knew she was able [有能力的，能够做某事的] to do it. She had always been strong, even if she didn't always feel it.
Looking above [在…之上，高于] her, Samantha noticed the blank walls and the empty shelves. It was strange how something as simple as 
the absence ['æbsəns] of objects could make a place feel so empty. But she knew that this was the absolute ['æbsəluːt] best thing for her.
She needed a fresh start, a chance to begin again.
As she packed her bags and prepared to go abroad [在国外，在国外的，出国], Samantha felt a sense of freedom she had never experienced before. 
She was excited about [关于，大约] the future and the endless possibilities that lay ahead. And as the plane took off,
she knew absolutely ['æbsəluːtli] that she had made the right decision.
